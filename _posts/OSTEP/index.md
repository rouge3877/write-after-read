# OSTEP: Operating Systems Three Easy Pieces

This is the my personal notes for the book [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/), which is a free online book about operating systems. The book is written by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau.

The book is divided into three parts:

1. Virtualization
2. Concurrency
3. Persistence

The book is available for free online at [http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/).
